Learning Devops Perission

Used nano and vim 

there are 3 types of perms 

- owner
- group 
- others

r - read
w - write
x - execute

rwx 

- means permission not granted

1. rw- read write and no execute
2. r-- read and no write and no execute


Numeric mapping

Symbol                                  value

 r                                        4
 w                                        2
 x                                        1


so for rw-       value will be 4+2 = 6
       r--       value will be 4
       rwx       value will be 4+2+1 = 7
